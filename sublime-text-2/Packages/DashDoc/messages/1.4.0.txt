DashDoc 1.4.0 is a major update (all credit goes @Teggy who made this possible).

This version requires Dash 1.9.3 or newer to work. Also, the default browsing
mode is syntax sensetive now (you might be interested in updating
syntax_sensitive_as_default property value if you have overrided it to false
for some reason).

The Dash proposed syntax mapping is in place, however you can override it on in
project settings or globally like this:

    "settings": {
      "syntax_docset_map": {
        "Objective-C": ["iphoneos", "cocos2d"]
      }
    }
