SublimeLinter for ST3
We need your help!
=====================

According to the Package Control site, SublimeLinter is the 4th most popular
plugin for Sublime Text, with 224K installs. That's an incredible number.
Thank you to everyone!

We all want SublimeLinter to become fully compatible with Sublime Text 3,
and we want it to be better supported. In moving to ST3 (and python 3),
we decided to start from scratch with a new architecture (based on sublimelint)
that allows us to get the most out of both ST3 and python 3. And we plan
to join forces with Ryan Hileman and merge sublimelint and SublimeLinter,
so we can pool our resources.

To find out more about what you can expect from SublimeLinter3,
read about it here:

To make this happen any time soon, we need your help. I have lots of other
projects that currently have a higher priority than SublimeLinter3. If you
value SublimeLinter and want to see it running on ST3 sooner rather than later,
please consider donating. If we can raise $3-5K, I'll move SublimeLinter3
to top of my priority list and finish it off within a week or two.

See the link above for info on donating.

Thanks again,
