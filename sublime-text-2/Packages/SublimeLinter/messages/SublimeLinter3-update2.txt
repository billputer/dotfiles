SublimeLinter for ST3
Fundraising update
October 31, 2013
=====================

Through October 30, we have raised $2885 (after fees) from 226 donations. Thank you for your support!
Development has started, and I’m very excited about this new version! But there is still a lot of work
to do, and I’m getting cool new ideas every day.

So if you are one of the thousands of happy SublimeLinter users who has not donated yet, it isn’t too late
to contribute. Please consider making a small donation to fund ongoing development and to compensate
Ryan Hileman for the great work on which SublimeLinter3 is based.

Open source software is not free! It is we the developers who usually end up paying for it.

Thanks again for your support,
