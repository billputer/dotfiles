Sublime SVN 1.3.0 Changelog:

** Note **
 - The "Update" command no longer by default updates externals. To update
   externals as well, please run "Update, Including Externals" from the "Other"
   submenu

New Features
 - Added support for svn+ssh:// repositories on Linux and OS X
 - Added the "hide_unversioned_in_commit" setting
 - Added the "Diff, Remote" commands under the "Other" submenu

Bug Fixes
 - Fixed handling of non-ASCII file paths and UTF-8 content in diff output on
   Windows machines

 - Added the MacPorts and WANdisco default install paths to the standard search
   path for OS X users to help prevent errors complaining about using 
   the v1.6 binary against a v1.7 working copy

 - Added a check to ensure Linux users have the en_US.UTF-8 locale installed
