Sublime SVN 1.1.0 Changelog:

** Note **
 - On Windows, all SVN working copies will be automatically upgraded to the
   new format for Subversion 1.7. This may require you to upgrade other
   SVN clients, such as TortoiseSVN.

New Features
 - Added Branch/Merge support for repositories using a structure where multiple
   projects are contained within a repository and each has a trunk and branches:
    /project1/trunk
    /project1/branches
    /project2/trunk
    /project2/branches

Bug Fixes
 - Fixed a bug with Commit buffers not getting syntax highlighting, and
   consequently making it impossible to commit

 - Fixed a warning about the plugin running too slow

 - Added support for nested SVN repositories that do not use svn:externals

 - Fixed handling of situation where the user's credentials can not list
   the files and folders in the repository root

 - Status and Commit commands alway work on the current folder or the whole
   working copy, and never on an individual file

 - Fixed Status and Commit commands to properly work on sub-folders

 - It is now possible to switch a repository that contains an external

 - Fixed bugs with filesystem monitoring so that there should no longer be
   notices about no files to commit when there really are

 - Added a work-around for an issue that could cause the plugin to not load
   when it is first installed
