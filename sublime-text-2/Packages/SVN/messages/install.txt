Thanks for installing Sublime SVN! Below are some quick notes to get you
started with the plugin. Please see http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/svn for
the full documentation.


There are two interfaces to use:
1. The Command Palette

   All commands are available here. To see the commands that are applicable
   to the current file, folder or working copy, look for the "Show Applicable"
   commands.

   The command palette is opened by Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux and
   Cmd+Shift+P on OS X.

2. Menus

   The side bar and editor context menus include basic commands.
