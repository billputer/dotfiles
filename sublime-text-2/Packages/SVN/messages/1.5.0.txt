Sublime SVN 1.5.0 Changelog:

** Backwards Compatibility Breaks **
 - Some of the commands were renamed, which may require you to update your
   key bindings. The following is a mapping of the old to new names:
     svn_commit      -> svn_folder_commit
     svn_file_commit -> svn_commit
     svn_diff        -> svn_folder_diff
     svn_file_diff   -> svn_diff
     svn_status      -> svn_folder_status
     svn_file_status -> svn_status

 - The menu structure and command palette changed, so various aspects of the
   interface will look a little different

New Features
 - Added "log_entries" setting to control the default number of log entries
   to display when running the "Log" command
   
 - SVN 1.6 and 1.7 are now both supported and bundled for Windows. This means
   1.6 working copies will no longer be automatically upgraded to 1.7!

 - Restructured the command palette so all commands are available without using
   "SVN: Other...". However, all commands are always shown when the current
   file is inside of an SVN working copy.

   The new "SVN: Show Applicable" commands will filter the list to show only
   the commands that are applicable in the current state. This was necessary
   due to performance issues.

 - Added enhanced error handling for Subversion being missing (such as on
   OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion)

 - Added enhanced error handling for situations where Sublime SVN detects the
   SVN 1.6 on your machine and you are editing an SVN 1.7 working copy

 - By default the package now remembers your last checkout URL and destination
   if you have not set the "default_checkout_url" and "default_checkout_folder"
   settings.

 - If the checkout destination parent folder does not exist, the user will be
   prompted to create it instead of displaying an error.

Bug Fixes
 - Compiled and bundled custom versions of SVN 1.6 and 1.7 to finally fix
   the locale issues for non-English users on Windows

 - Fixed locale issues that would cause problems for some Linux users

 - Removed folder monitoring (due to performance issues), which resolves the
   inotify issues some Linux users were having, and other performance issues
   especially for users with large working copies

 - Fixed handling of property conflict on folders

 - Fixed handling of merge conflicts and related files

 - Enhanced the plugin to prompt for a login and password if the user is trying
   to perform operations that require write access to the repository, but
   the current credentials only provide read access
