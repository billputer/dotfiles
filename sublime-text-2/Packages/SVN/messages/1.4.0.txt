Sublime SVN 1.4.0 Changelog:

New Features
 - Added support for UNC/samba paths on Windows

 - Added code to unfocus and refocus on the current buffer after a
   Revert command is executed so that the built-in Sublime Text file refresh
   dialog is presented to the user

 - Added the "Unlock Interactive" command

 - If the 'Commit" command is executed, but no files have been modified and one
   or more files is locked, the new "Unlock Interative" command is executed
   instead

Bug Fixes
 - Added code to handle broken output of SVN on windows when showing logs and
   file listings for non-ASCII file paths on machines with non-English locales

 - Added error checking for the "svn_binary_path" setting

 - Fixed encoding errors when a password prompted is dismissed without any input

 - Fixed multiple authentication hangs on Windows that could cause "svn.exe"
   processes to be spawned, but never terminated

 - Fixed "svn://" protocol repository URLs on Windows when the username and
   password are embedded in the URL

 - Fixed a bug where failed lock attempts would be reported as successful

 - Fixed a bug where the user would not be notified if another user already had
   a lock on a file

 - Fixed the "Commit" dialog to not show a checkbox next to paths that have no
   modifications, but are locked
